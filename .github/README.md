# Sylox - Syntactic Logic Exploration
Enhancing Code Reasoning through Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Python 3.12.9 and CUDA 12.8 with PyTorch 2.8.0.

## Overview

Sylox is a research project focused on improving code reasoning capabilities in small to medium-scale language models through specialized fine-tuning. The project explores the enhancement of multiple pre-trained models using custom coding datasets to optimize their performance in software development tasks.

## Objectives

Enhance code comprehension and interpretation capabilities, Improve logical reasoning in programming contexts, Optimize problem-solving accuracy, Evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning on smaller scale models, Provide insights for domain-specific LLM optimization.
